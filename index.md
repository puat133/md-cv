## Currently

I'm an Assistant Professor at Control and Instrumentation Engineering Department of [King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa). I teach numerous courses in both graduate and undergraduate level, as well as carrying out research in control and filtering. I enjoy teaching and interacting with students from different background.


## Employment

`2021-` 
__King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals__ Assistant Professor at Control and Instrumentation Engineering.

> I have taught courses for both undergraduate and graduate level. I developed courses materials, including a modern set of presentation slides using Markdown and many repositories for codes related to the courses. I supervise several master and undergraduate final projects. I also actively conduct research in the field of state-estimation and filtering, non-linear control, quantum system and control design.






`2018-2021` 
__Aalto University__ Postdoctoral Researcher.
> I have been involved in a variety of research initiatives over this career. The subject of research was applied statistics, with a particular emphasis on deep Gaussian processes and advanced mathematical modeling. I established generic spatio-temporal statistics mathematical approaches. The majority of the simulations are written in Python using Jax and Numba/CuPY (including costumed CUDA kernels).

`2017-2018` 
__Australian National University__ Postdoctoral Researcher.
> I conducted research in the field of quantum control theory throughout this phase of my career, focusing on systems theory methods to modeling and robust design of quantum information processing devices.
